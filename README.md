# SHAP 0.42.2 Patch July 2023
Patch for shap **0.42.2** that works with **numpy > 1.20**


## Problem
Since 1.24.0 numpy deprecated some methods which were used in shap, the library got broken. A small fix to which is downgrading the version of numpy


## Instructions
+ Download the **shap** folder from the repository
+ Replace it with your device's **pip** packages folder, which might be different for differnt OS. For example, my pip packages were present in **/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/lib/python3.11/site-packages**
+ Happy Shapingggg.....
